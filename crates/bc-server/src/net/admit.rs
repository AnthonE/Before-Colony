//! Who gets a connection (`docs/PEERS.md`, "Staying up"; `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, "Under abuse").
//!
//! Titanfall's servers were DDoSed out of the game for years. A flood of packets is for the
//! network upstream of the server to stop (a host's scrubbing, a firewall's rate limits); what the
//! server does is keep a flood of *connections* from crowding the pilots out:
//! - **Retry under load.** With more than [`Limits::retry_above`] handshakes under way, an address
//!   that hasn't proved it hears back (QUIC's address validation) is sent a Retry first: a flood
//!   from spoofed addresses never gets as far as a handshake.
//! - **A share per address.** One address holds at most [`Limits::per_address`] connections,
//!   handshaking or open. Loopback is excepted: the server's own agents connect from it.
//! - **A ceiling.** At most [`Limits::connections`] in all.
//! - **A deadline.** A handshake, QUIC's and WebTransport's, finishes within [`HANDSHAKE`].
//!
//! What a session may do once it's in is limited where it's read (`session.rs`: inputs, the
//! radio, and the hangar's requests).
