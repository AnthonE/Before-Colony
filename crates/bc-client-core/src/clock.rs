//! Server-time estimation and input lead.
//!
//! - `server_now(now)` is the server's simulation time in ticks (continuous): snapshot `T` is
//!   produced as tick `T` completes, so on arrival the server is about half an RTT past `T`.
//! - Commands for tick `k` must reach the server before it simulates `k`. The client runs its
//!   input clock `lead` ticks ahead of `server_now`, steering `lead` so the server never reports
//!   less than ~2 ticks of buffered input (`input_health`). It is the *minimum* that matters: a
//!   client that sends in bursts (a slow frame rate, an agent that thinks twice a second) has a
//!   full buffer just after each burst and an empty one just before the next.
//! - Remote entities are drawn `interp_delay` ticks in the past, between two received snapshots.
//! - What is drawn runs on eased clocks: the times the own suit and everyone else are drawn at
//!   ([`Clock::own_tick`], [`Clock::view_tick`]) follow their estimates at a few percent off real
//!   time rather than jumping with each correction, so nothing on screen lurches when the clock is
//!   put right. Commands are scheduled on the raw estimate ([`Clock::input_tick`]).
