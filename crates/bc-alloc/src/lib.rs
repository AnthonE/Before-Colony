//! Counting global allocator.
//!
//! Tests install [`CountingAlloc`] as the `#[global_allocator]` and wrap the code under test in
//! [`count`] to prove that a region performs zero heap operations. This works in release builds too,
//! unlike debug-only guards.
//!
//! The server installs it as well and marks each sector tick as a hot region with [`set_hot`]. Any
//! heap operation inside a hot region increments [`violations`], which `/status` reports. It does
//! not panic, because panicking inside an allocator would abort the process.
//!
//! Tracking is per thread. A const-initialised thread-local `Cell` never allocates, so checking the
//! flag is free when tracking is off.

// GlobalAlloc is an unsafe trait; this is the only crate in the workspace that needs `unsafe`.
